//Note falls are not at 60fps
You will be required to convert the audio format to 48000Hz, 16bit WAV in order for the notes to drop at 60fps. This is a bug that continues to persist in the website version that we have no idea how to fix.

//BPM Change
*NOTE: It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to save the chart every single time you create a BPM change, or else there may be some issues based on the original code built by omegaPi
*NOTE 2: Creating a Map in DynaMaker uses BarPerMinute, but BPM change requires BeatPerMinute instead.
To change BPM:
1. Right Click and use the 4th option of the dropdown menu
2. Click [BPM Change]
3. Press [↓] from your keyboard and place the "BPM note” anywhere
4. Set the BPM to your desired BPM change and hit [Set]
5. You should see the changed BPM at the bottom right

To return to editing mode:
1. Right Click and try and placing a note.
2. If you see the BPM Change UI, hit [Cancel]
3. If notes still cannot be placed, hit [Enter]
4. If it still doesn't work, save the chart and reload the chart through DynaMaker

//What should I do if I had the wrong BPM change set?
*NOTE: BarPerMinute = BeatPerMinute/4
Scroll to the bottom and find the corresponding [m_time] and change the BeatPerMinute at the corresponding [m_value].
